## About Me

<span class="image left"><img src="{{ "/images/pic04.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>

Business | Data | Language

In my formative years, I took up Japanese as a third language. Learning the syntax, vocabulary and grammar patterns, I made steady progress, eventually attaining the JLPT N2 certification. 

Later on, in my university days, I decided to do my undergraduate studies in Business Administration, thinking that the degree could help me when I wanted to launch my own business someday. My data-driven nature, and need to quantify all things in a rational way, led me to specialize in Finance. 

It was the same curiosity and interest in **doing more with data** that led me to take the Data Science Immersive with General Assembly. I saw that many industries were being disrupted / transformed by the use of AI and machine learning, and wanted to gain hands-on knowledge. 

There is much to learn in this field. I may not know everything there is to know yet, and the learning curve is steep. But I look back at the old me when I was first starting out with Japanese, and realize that the journey will look the same - tough in the beginning, but sweeter towards the end. Life is a never-ending journey of attaining more knowledge and I am strapped in for the long haul!
